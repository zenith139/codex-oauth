# Implementation Details

This document describes how `codex-oauth` stores accounts, synchronizes auth files, and manages local state under `~/.codex`. Outbound API refresh rules, endpoint contracts, and grouped account-name sync examples now live in [docs/api-refresh.md](./api-refresh.md).

## Packaging and Release

- Release automation and CI workflow details live in [docs/release.md](./release.md).
- The CLI binary version is defined in `src/version.zig` and must match the npm package version and any release tag version without the leading `v`.
- Historical GitHub-release installs could place a standalone binary under `~/.local/bin`; this is separate from the npm package path and can shadow newer npm or local-build installs if left on `PATH`.

## File Layout

- `~/.codex/auth.json`
- `~/.codex/accounts/registry.json`
- `~/.codex/accounts/<account file key>.auth.json`
- `~/.codex/accounts/auth.json.bak.YYYYMMDD-hhmmss[.N]`
- `~/.codex/accounts/registry.json.bak.YYYYMMDD-hhmmss[.N]`
- `~/.codex/sessions/...`

`codex-oauth` resolves `codex_home` from the real user home directory:

1. `HOME/.codex`
2. `USERPROFILE/.codex` (Windows fallback)

## Testing Conventions (BDD Style on std.testing)

- The project keeps using Zig native tests rooted at `src/main.zig`.
- The current `zig build test` step compiles the test binary but does not execute it.
- To run the tests locally, use `zig test src/main.zig -lc`.
- BDD scenarios are expressed in Zig `test` blocks with descriptive names like:
  - `Scenario: Given ... when ... then ...`
- Reusable Given/When/Then setup logic should live in test-only helper/context code under `src/tests/` (for example `*_bdd_test.zig` plus helper modules).
- Existing unit-style tests remain valid; BDD-style tests should prioritize behavior flows and branches that are not already covered.

## First Run and Empty Registry

- If `registry.json` is empty and `~/.codex/auth.json` exists, the tool auto-imports it into `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json`.
- If the registry is empty and there is no `auth.json`, `list` shows no accounts; use `codex-oauth login` or `codex-oauth import`.

## Registry Compatibility

- `registry.json.schema_version` is the on-disk migration gate.
- The current binary supports all released schemas:
  - `schema_version = 3` is the current layout with record-keyed snapshots, active-account activation timestamps, and per-account local rollout dedupe.
  - `version = 2` legacy registries using `active_email` and email-keyed snapshots are auto-migrated to schema `3`.
- The current binary also accepts current-layout files that still use the legacy top-level key `version = 3`, or still carry the old global `last_attributed_rollout` shape, and rewrites them once to the normalized `schema_version = 3` format.
- Loading a supported older schema performs the migration in memory and then rewrites `registry.json` in the current format.
- Loading a newer `schema_version` is rejected with `UnsupportedRegistryVersion`; older binaries must not silently rewrite newer registry files.
- Saving always rewrites `registry.json` into the current field set with `schema_version = 3`.
- Unknown extra fields are still ignored on load and dropped on save, so additive compatibility is only guaranteed for schemas explicitly supported by the current binary.
- See `docs/schema-migration.md` for the versioning policy and migration rules.

## Account Identity

`codex-oauth` now separates the user identity from the ChatGPT workspace/account context.

- `tokens.account_id` is the raw ChatGPT workspace/account context ID used for API calls. In the registry it is stored as `chatgpt_account_id`.
- The JWT claim `https://api.openai.com/auth.chatgpt_account_id` must exist and match `tokens.account_id`.
- `chatgpt_user_id` is read from the JWT auth claims (`chatgpt_user_id`, falling back to `user_id`).
- The local unique key is `record_key = chatgpt_user_id + "::" + chatgpt_account_id`.
- The registry field `account_key` stores this local `record_key`, not the raw ChatGPT workspace/account ID.
- The auth snapshot file key is derived from `record_key`:
  - filename-safe IDs keep the raw `record_key`
  - other IDs are base64url-encoded before writing `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json`
- Email is normalized to lowercase, but it is only a display/grouping field instead of the unique key.

## Auth Parsing

`auth.json` is parsed as follows:

- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present, the account is treated as API-key auth (`auth_mode = apikey`).
- Otherwise it requires:
  - `tokens.access_token` for ChatGPT usage API refresh
  - `tokens.account_id`
  - `tokens.id_token`
  - JWT `https://api.openai.com/auth.chatgpt_account_id`
- The CLI decodes the JWT and reads `email`, `chatgpt_account_id`, `chatgpt_user_id` (or fallback `user_id`), and `chatgpt_plan_type`.
- If `account_id` is missing or mismatched between token fields and JWT claims, import/login fails. Existing-registry foreground/background sync treats that auth as unsyncable and skips it.
- If `chatgpt_user_id` is missing, import/login fails. Existing-registry foreground/background sync treats that auth as unsyncable and skips it.
- If plan is missing, it remains blank in the registry. If email is missing, the account is not imported/synced.

## Import Behavior

- `codex-oauth import <path>` auto-detects the path type:
  - file path: imports one auth/config file.
  - directory path: batch imports config files from that directory.
- `codex-oauth import --cpa [<path>]` imports flat CPA token JSON:
  - explicit file path: imports one CPA JSON file
  - explicit directory path: batch imports direct child `.json` files from that directory
  - omitted path: defaults to `~/.cli-proxy-api` and scans direct child `.json` files there
- CPA imports convert each source file in memory to the current standard auth snapshot layout before writing `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json`.
- CPA conversion expects the flat fields `id_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `account_id`, and `last_refresh`; `refresh_token` is required and missing/empty values are skipped as `MissingRefreshToken`.
- CPA imports keep the current report formatting and stream split used by standard imports.
- `--cpa` cannot be combined with `--purge`.
- `codex-oauth import --purge [<path>]` rebuilds `registry.json` from scratch using the imported auth set for the current binary format.
- During `--purge`, `auto_switch` and `api` configuration are carried forward from an existing `registry.json`; account snapshots, stored usage, active-account activation time, and per-account local rollout dedupe state are cleared and rebuilt from auth files.
- When `--purge` is used without a path, the source defaults to `~/.codex/accounts/` and scans direct child auth files from that directory: current account snapshots (`*.auth.json`) plus `auth.json.bak.*` backups.
- If `~/.codex/accounts/` is missing during `--purge`, it is treated as an empty snapshot set and the command still attempts to import the current `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- `--purge` always tries to import the current `~/.codex/auth.json` last; if it is parseable, that account's `record_key` becomes `active_account_key`.
- If `--purge` rebuilds accounts successfully but still has no active account afterward, it activates the first rebuilt account in sorted order and rewrites `~/.codex/auth.json` through the normal switch path, preserving the previous file as `auth.json.bak.*` when the contents changed.
- When multiple scanned auth files map to the same `record_key`, `--purge` keeps only the newest snapshot for that account before rebuilding `registry.json`.
- `--purge` rebuilds `registry.json` and rewrites imported snapshots into the current `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json` naming/layout for each auth file it can parse successfully.
- Rebuilt `registry.json` account entries are ordered by normalized `email`, then `account_key`.
- `--purge` does not delete old snapshot files or backups, so stale pre-migration snapshot filenames may still remain until cleaned up separately.
- `--purge` is a recovery fallback when a registry cannot be migrated automatically; it is not the normal upgrade path between supported schemas.
- Directory import scans only direct child files with a `.json` suffix (non-recursive), imports valid auth files, and skips invalid/malformed entries.
- Directory import and purge print a progress preamble like `Scanning <path>...`, then one line per import result, then an `Import Summary: ...` line.
- Single-file import prints one result line:
  - `✓ imported` for a new account
  - `✓ updated` when the target account already exists
  - `✗ skipped` plus a short reason for parse/validation failures
- Single-file import prints a summary only when the file is skipped; the current format is `Import Summary: 0 imported, 1 skipped`.
- Import output is split by stream:
  - `stdout`: scanning lines, `imported`/`updated` lines, and summaries
  - `stderr`: `skipped` lines and alias-ignore warnings
- Import result labels use the input filename with a trailing `.json` or `.auth.json` removed.
- JSON parse failures are rendered as the user-facing reason `MalformedJson`; semantic validation errors keep explicit names such as `MissingEmail` or `MissingChatgptUserId`.
- During `--purge`, duplicate snapshot candidates that lose to a newer snapshot are reported as `skipped` with the reason `SupersededByNewerSnapshot`.
- During `--purge`, if the current `~/.codex/auth.json` is imported last, it is reported as `auth.json (active)` and counted in the purge summary.
- Only `import` can set account `alias` (via `--alias` on single-file import).
- For directory import or `--purge` without an explicit file path, `--alias` is ignored.
- Non-import flows (`login`, auto-import on empty registry, and sync-created accounts) leave `alias` empty.

## Sync Behavior (Token Refresh Safety)

Each command (`list`, `remove`) runs `syncActiveAccountFromAuth` before doing its main work. This is the mechanism that prevents stale refresh tokens when `auth.json` is updated by Codex.

The sync flow is:

1. Read `~/.codex/auth.json` and parse email/plan/auth mode.
2. Match by **record_key** (`chatgpt_user_id + "::" + chatgpt_account_id`) against the registry.
3. If a `record_key` match is found:
   - Set that account as active.
   - Update the stored email/plan/auth mode from the current auth.
   - Update the stored `chatgpt_account_id` and `chatgpt_user_id` fields from the current auth.
   - Overwrite `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json` with the current `auth.json` if content differs.
4. If no `record_key` match is found:
   - Create a **new** account record for that auth snapshot.
   - Import the current `auth.json` into `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json`.

If `auth.json` has no email, no `tokens.account_id`, no `chatgpt_user_id`, or cannot be parsed, existing-registry sync is skipped and the foreground command/daemon continues using the registry state already on disk. The empty-registry auto-import path still requires a parseable auth file.

Important limits:

- Foreground commands sync `auth.json` strictly by `record_key`; there is no alternate key or “active” heuristic.
- When background auto-switching is enabled, a background worker keeps checking rollout usage and can switch accounts without a foreground `codex-oauth` command.

## Switching Accounts

There is no foreground `switch` command anymore. Account selection is now implicit:

- `login` and single-file `import` activate the newly added account
- `remove` promotes the best remaining account when it deletes the current one
- background auto-switching rewrites `auth.json` when the active account falls below threshold

The registry still keeps `active_account_key` so proxy routing, removal fallback, and the background watcher know which snapshot currently owns `~/.codex/auth.json`.

## Removing Accounts

`remove` now supports three foreground modes:

- Interactive: `codex-oauth remove`
- Query-driven: `codex-oauth remove <query>`
- Clear-all: `codex-oauth remove --all`

For query-driven removal, the target query is matched case-insensitively by:

- alias fragment
- email fragment

If no accounts match, the command prints an error and exits non-zero.
If exactly one account matches, it is removed immediately.
If multiple accounts match in a TTY session, the command prints the matched account labels using the same display grouping as `list` and asks for confirmation with `Confirm delete? [y/N]:`; only `y` or `Y` proceeds.
If multiple accounts match and stdin is not a TTY, the command exits non-zero instead of reading the pipe as confirmation input; the user must refine the query or rerun it interactively.

When an account is removed, `codex-oauth` deletes both:

- the account snapshot `accounts/<account file key>.auth.json`
- any parseable `accounts/auth.json.bak.*` backup files whose auth `record_key` matches the removed account

Malformed or non-parseable `auth.json.bak.*` files are left in place for manual cleanup or `codex-oauth clean`.

If the removed account was the active one:

- when other accounts still remain, `codex-oauth` activates the remaining account with the best current usage score
- if `~/.codex/auth.json` is missing and another account remains, `remove` recreates it from the replacement account snapshot
- `~/.codex/auth.json` is only rewritten or deleted when the current auth file is syncable and can be identified as the removed active account
- when no accounts remain and the current active auth file matches the removed active account, `codex-oauth` deletes `~/.codex/auth.json`
- if the current `~/.codex/auth.json` is malformed, unsyncable, or otherwise does not match the removed active account, `remove` leaves that file untouched

For `remove --all`, the command clears all accounts tracked in `registry.json` and deletes any matching managed snapshots/backups. If the current `~/.codex/auth.json` is syncable and its `record_key` matches one of those tracked accounts, `remove --all` deletes it even when `active_account_key` is null or stale. If the current `~/.codex/auth.json` is malformed, unsyncable, or otherwise cannot be identified as one of those tracked accounts, `remove --all` leaves that file untouched.
During remove reconciliation, a dangling `active_account_key` is treated the same as an unset active account so the command can promote a remaining account or finish clearing `~/.codex/auth.json`.

After a successful deletion, stdout prints `Removed N account(s): ...` using the removed account emails in removal order.

When `remove` is run without a query and stdin is not a TTY, the command falls back to the numbered selector and accepts only strict numeric selections like `1 2` or `1,2`; other piped input is rejected.

## Background Auto Switch

The detailed runtime, thresholds, service model, and data-source priority rules for auto-switching now live in `docs/auto-switch.md`.

This document keeps only the cross-reference points that matter to the rest of the implementation:

- background config still lives in `registry.json` under top-level `auto_switch` and `api` blocks
- managed services still resolve install paths from the real user home directory
- successful foreground `codex-oauth` commands except `help`, `version`, `status`, and internal `daemon` still reconcile the managed service definition
- Linux/WSL `config auto enable` still requires a working `systemd --user` session

## Backups

- `auth.json` backups are created only when the contents change.
- `registry.json` backups are created only when the contents change.
- Both are stored under `~/.codex/accounts/` using the local-time filename format `*.bak.YYYYMMDD-hhmmss` (with `.N` added only on same-second collisions) and capped at the most recent 5 files.
- If local-time conversion is unavailable, backup filenames fall back to `*.bak.<unix-seconds>`.
- `codex-oauth clean` is whitelist-based for the current schema and only affects `~/.codex/accounts/`: it keeps only live snapshot files referenced by the registry and deletes other stale entries under `accounts/`.
- If `accounts/registry.json` is missing, `codex-oauth clean` still prunes backup files but skips stale snapshot deletion so recovery snapshots remain available for `import --purge` or manual repair.


## Usage and Rate Limits

Detailed API-backed refresh behavior now lives in [docs/api-refresh.md](./api-refresh.md). This section keeps only the local-state and rollout rules that interact with the rest of the implementation.

Foreground usage refresh still depends on `api.usage`:

1. If `api.usage = true`, the API contract and timing rules are defined in [docs/api-refresh.md](./api-refresh.md).
2. If `api.usage = false`, read only the newest `~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` file by `mtime`.

- Local rollout watcher logs print the actual window lengths from the snapshot first, then the local event timestamp, then the full rollout basename (including the UUID suffix); when the newest event has no usable usage windows the same `[local]` log line also adds `fallback-to-api`.
- The rollout scanner looks for `type:"event_msg"` and `payload.type:"token_count"`.
- The rollout scanner reads only the newest rollout file. Within that file, it uses the last `token_count` event whose `rate_limits` payload is a parseable object.
- If the newest rollout file has no usable `rate_limits` payload (for example `rate_limits: null` on every `token_count` event), refresh does not overwrite the account's existing stored usage snapshot.
- Local-session refresh never uses a global rollout watermark. Instead it compares the rollout event timestamp against the current active account's activation time; rollout events older than that activation point are treated as stale and are not reassigned to the new active account.
- Each account stores its own last consumed local rollout signature `(path, event_timestamp_ms)`, so repeated local refreshes for the same account do not reapply the same rollout event.
- Rate limits are mapped by `window_minutes`: `300` → 5h, `10080` → weekly (fallback to primary/secondary).
- If `resets_at` is in the past, the UI shows `100%`.
- `last_usage_at` stores the last time a newly observed snapshot was written; identical API refreshes leave it unchanged.
- The background auto-switch watcher has its own near-real-time refresh strategy; see `docs/auto-switch.md`.
- In watcher mode, rollout scanning caches the newest rollout file between bounded full rescans so large `~/.codex/sessions` trees are not fully re-walked on every 1-second loop.
- The free-plan `35%` real-time guard applies only when the 5h trigger comes from an actual 300-minute window or an unlabeled primary window; weekly-only free accounts still switch based on the configured weekly threshold.
- For auto-switch candidate scoring, free accounts that expose only a single weekly (`10080`-minute) window still remain eligible and use that weekly remaining percentage as their candidate score.
- On Linux/WSL, watcher installation/removal now explicitly deletes the old `codex-oauth-autoswitch.timer` unit file so legacy minute-timer installs do not continue to fire after migration to the watcher service.
- The rollout files still do not expose a stable account identity, so local-session ownership remains activation-window based rather than identity based.

Current registry/account field roles:

- `account_key`: local `record_key`, used for registry identity, snapshot filenames, switching, and `active_account_key`
- `chatgpt_account_id`: raw ChatGPT workspace/account context ID from `tokens.account_id`, used for usage API requests
- `chatgpt_user_id`: user identity component from the JWT, used to build `record_key`

Latest rollout `.jsonl` rate limit record shape (from an `event_msg` + `token_count` line):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-07T17:24:21.123Z",
  "type": "event_msg",
  "payload": {
    "type": "token_count",
    "info": {
      "total_token_usage": { "total_tokens": 1234, "input_tokens": 900, "output_tokens": 334, "cached_input_tokens": 0 },
      "last_token_usage":  { "total_tokens": 200,  "input_tokens": 150, "output_tokens": 50,  "cached_input_tokens": 0 },
      "model_context_window": 128000
    },
    "rate_limits": {
      "primary":   { "used_percent": 60.0, "window_minutes": 300, "resets_at": 1735689600 },
      "secondary": { "used_percent": 20.0, "window_minutes": 10080, "resets_at": 1736294400 },
      "credits":   { "has_credits": true, "unlimited": false, "balance": "12.34" },
      "plan_type": "pro"
    }
  }
}
```

## Output Notes

- Default list table columns: `ACCOUNT`, `PLAN`, `5H USAGE`, `WEEKLY`, `LAST ACTIVITY`.
- `list` adds a zero-padded leading row number for selectable accounts, such as `01`, `02`.
- Human-readable `list` and `remove` group records by email when the same email owns multiple account snapshots.
- In grouped output:
  - the top-level email line is a header only
  - child rows are the selectable accounts
  - alias takes precedence for the child label
  - otherwise the child label is the plan name (`team`, `plus`, etc.)
  - repeated plans under the same email are rendered as stable numbered labels like `team #1`, `team #2`
- Single-account emails still render as one flat row; when an alias is set, that row shows `(alias)email`.
- The remove UI shows `ACCOUNT`, `PLAN`, `5H`, `WEEKLY`, `LAST`, and preserves grouped child indentation.
- Usage limit cells show remaining percent plus reset time: `NN% (HH:MM)` for same-day resets, or `NN% (HH:MM on D Mon)` when the reset is on a different day.
- `LAST ACTIVITY` is derived from `last_usage_at` and rendered as a relative time like `Now` or `2m ago`.
- `PLAN` comes from the auth claim when available, and falls back to the last usage snapshot's `plan_type` (e.g. `free`, `plus`, `team`).
